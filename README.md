## Background

The mission of the [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE), housed within the [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov) (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

At the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/) (HUD), the Cloud Adoption CoE was tasked with analyzing systems and applications to recommend optimal pathways to modernization using cloud adoption.

## Purpose

HUD maintains a library of 951 paper forms, and receives millions of completed paper or scanned form submissions annually. Many of these are processed manually, where a person performs manual data re-entry before archiving the paper form. HUD needs to transition to a digital process, turning paper forms into web-based forms, and ensuring that paper submissions that currently exist and may be submitted in the future are turned into digital submissions. The Government requires all 951 static paper-based forms to be converted into web-based adaptive forms. 

Furthermore, a select number of more complex use cases (5-10) will be integrated through the combination of all the components to provide an end-to-end capability. Section 1.2.1 *(note: in the draft RFQ)* provides one example of an illustrative potential use case the Government intends to address, staggered such that they are addressed relatively simultaneously, through this procurement.
