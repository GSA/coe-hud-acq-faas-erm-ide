## Background

The mission of the Centers of Excellence (CoE), housed within the General Services Administration (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

At the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Cloud Adoption CoE was tasked with analyzing systems and applications to recommend optimal pathways to modernization using cloud adoption.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this procurement is for a cloud-based electronic records management (ERM) system to support multiple data sources, as well an intelligent data extraction (IDE) capability for the extraction of written material from paper forms. The first goal is to set up a repository for new and existing records, around which additional data flow automation can be constructed.

The Government requires conversion of paper-based submissions, which includes standard forms and supporting documentation, to be digitized using intelligent data extraction and ingested into a cloud-based electronic records management ERM solution. HUD maintains a library of 951 paper forms, and receives millions of completed paper or scanned form submissions annually. Many of these are processed manually, where a person performs manual data re-entry before archiving the paper form. HUD plans to transition gradually to a digital process, turning paper forms into web-based forms, while ensuring that paper submissions that currently exist and may be submitted in the future are turned into digital submissions. The Government may require, on an optional basis, all 951 static paper-based forms to be eventually converted into web-based adaptive forms.

In this procurement, a select number of the more complex use cases (~10) may be integrated in the base year through the combination of all the components to provide an end-to-end capability that can be replicated among other forms through exercising them as optional tasks. Section 7.4 provides an initial backlog of epics the Government intends to implement in the base year of performance, staggered such that they are addressed relatively simultaneously, through this procurement. Use cases, which are optional tasks, may be exercised anytime during the period of performance in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity-Separately Priced Line Item.
